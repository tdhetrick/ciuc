This project is to create a tool to allow teachers to verify if students are coding within expected patters in an efforts to reduce acidemic integrity issues.

## Week 02
I have developed a chrome extension that can monitor a html element for changes. This has been designed to with the codingrooms.com editor. This editor's behavior is not like that of a typical input element. It is a div with a series of spans representing the lines in the editor. When a line is clicked on it becomes edit able. Lines also disappear and reappear as the the window is scrolled over the code. 

The result is that not all of the code necessarily is in the html at one time. This is not so much an issue when monitoring changes, but does keep you from having a full view of all the code at the moment of change. Large changes can be detected, and activity monitored.
